# Tarazed
A simple app for creating and tracking personalised workout plans. Available on Android, Windows and Linux, the app allows you to synchronise your data so you can easily switch between devices without losing progress.

# Client
The application is developed using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI), providing high performance and native integration with platforms.

# Server side:
The server side is implemented on ASP.NET Core, which provides high performance, scalability and support for modern development standards. ASP.NET Core allows to efficiently process requests from clients.

# Data synchronisation:
User data is stored on the server, making it accessible from any device. Synchronisation between client applications and the server is implemented via REST API to ensure instant data updates.
